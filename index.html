          Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. 
Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets.[4] Dogs eat both meat and vegetables, often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs. 
They are sometimes called "canines" from the Latin word for dog - canis. Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe other canids, such as wolves. A baby dog is called a pup or puppy. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old. 
Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans.

         Appearance and behaviour  </h2>
        <h6>Posted on 07-07-2018</h6>
        
        <p>Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. Dogs often chase cats, and most dogs will fetch a ball or stick. 
Dogs can smell and hear better than humans, but cannot see well in color because they are color blind. Due to the anatomy of the eye, dogs can see better in dim light than humans. They also have a wider field of vision. 
Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called packs. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the alpha male. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male.</p><br>

 <h2 id="1">Lifespan</h2>
 <h6>Posted on 06-06-2018</h6>     
 <p>
     Different dog breeds have different lifespans. In general, smaller dogs live longer than bigger ones.The size and the breed of the dog change how long the dog lives, on average. Breeds such as the Dachshund usually live for fifteen years, Chihuahuas can reach age twenty. The Great Dane, on the other hand has an average lifespan of six to eight years; some Great Danes have lived for ten years.

  <h2 id="2">Origin of dogs </h2>
 <h6>Posted on 05-05-2018</h6>     
 <p>All dogs are descended from wolves, by domestication and artificial selection. This is known because DNA genome analysis has been done to discover this.They have been bred by humans. The earliest known fossil of a domestic dog is from 31,700 years ago in Belgium. Dogs have lived with people for at least 30,000 years. In 2013, a study was published that showed that the skull and teeth of a canid, dated to 33,000 years ago, had characteristics closer to a dog than to a wolf, and the authors conclude that "this specimen may represent a dog in the very early stages of domestication, i.e. an “incipient” dog." The researchers go on to suggest that it was, however, a line that did not lead to modern dogs. Genetically, this material is closer to that of a modern dog than to that of a wolf. Other signs of domestication are that sometimes, dogs were buried together with humans.[11] Evidence of this is a tomb in Bonn, where a man of about 50 years of age, a woman of about 25 years of age, the remains of a dog, plus other artifacts were found. Radiocarbon dating showed that the human bones were between 13.300 and 14.000 years old. </p>

  <h2 id="3">Dogs and humans</h2>
 <h6>Posted on 04-04-2018</h6>     
 <p>Dogs are often called "man's best friend" because they fit in with human life. Man refers to humankind and not just guys (Old English). Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, guide dogs for blind people, and police dogs. There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or illegal drugs. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually beagles) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs have even been sent by Russians into outer space, a few years before any human being. The first dog sent up was named Laika, but she died within a few hours.</p>

   <h2 id="4">Dog breeds</h2>
 <h6>Posted on 03-03-2018</h6>     
 <p>There are at least 800 breeds (kinds) of dogs. Dogs whose parents were the same breed will also be that breed: these dogs are called purebred or pure pedigree dogs. Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed: they are called mutts, mixed-breed dogs, hybrids, or mongrels. Some of the most popular breeds are sheepdogs, collies, poodles and retrievers. It is becoming popular to breed together two different breeds of dogs and call the new dog's breed a name that is a mixture of the parents' breeds' two names. A puppy with a poodle and a pomeranian as parents might be called a Pomapoo. These kinds of dogs, instead of being called mutts, are known as designer dog breeds. These dogs are normally used for prize shows and designer shows. They can be guide dogs. </p>

    <h2 id="9">The Story of  Ashpie </h2>
 <h6>Posted on 12-12-2017</h6>     
 <p> Hi, My name is Ashpie and I just got a dog named Buddy! He is a Husky pup, isn't he cute!  He brings so much joy into my life and helps me not to be so bored anymore.  Buddy keeps me so busy and is a great way for me to stop thinking about food all the time and do something  fun.  I used to feel so lonely and bored and I think I ate just because I was bored, not because I was hungry.  But now, Im too busy to eat!  I get lots more exercise with Buddy. <br>
My Dad said I could get a dog if I would take care of it and be responsable for his care.  We picked up Buddy at the dog pound so he didn't cost us lots of money.  We had to paid for his shots that's all. The minute I saw him, I knew he was the one.  Once I held him, I knew he would be mine and I instantly named him "Buddy."  He already felt like a good friend!  Now, I had my very own dog and my very own responsability.<br>
When Buddy was a pup, I had to teach him to go to the bathroom on papers and outside.  He would wake me up really early by barking at the foot of my bed so I had to get up and let him outside.  Then he climbed back to bed and snuggled with me.  He was so warm and cozy and we both fell back fast asleep.<br>
Now Buddy is all grown up.  Here we are outside playing.  I make sure Buddy goes for walks and that's a great way to make sure that I go for walks too.  So, we both win!  Buddy gets exercise and so do I.  Because Buddy needs exercise everyday, I get good exercise too.  I make sure Buddy gets lots of water when we come back from exercise, just like I do. Sometimes we walk down to Lake Alice, about 4 blocks away and go along the Lake.  My Dad comes with us sometimes so I get to be with my Dad and Buddy at the same time.  That is so great. Then my Dad gets exercise too!<br>
Buddy likes to eat lots.  Because he is growing he needs certain kinds of food.  I learned from the veterinarian what to feed him and how much so I don't over feed him.  Dogs are like people, they need the right amount of food and exercise to be healthy.  This helps me to learn more about watching what I eat and to eat only when I am hungry.<br>
Buddy does lots of tricks.  Already and I've taught him how to roll over and to stop.  He sometimes does it right and when he doesn't,  I have to remember, he is only a pup.  I give him extra hugs for rewards when he does a trick, not food.  That way I don't over feed him.<br>
Having Buddy makes me feel needed and loved.  I would recommend getting a pet if you are lonely or bored.  A pet can fill up your day with lots of activity and keeps you more healthy by exercising more.  I feel better now that I get more exercise and I'm just happier.  I don't think about loosing weight, I think about getting exercise, being more healthy and enjoying my new friend.  I hope you like my story.</p>

   <h2 id="10">The story of Sonya </h2>
 <h6>Posted on 10-10-2017</h6> 
 <p>Our kids would beg for a dog and I'd say "it's a dog or me, your choice!" First off, I thought I was allergic to dogs, and second, I thought of a dog as just another thing I'd need to take care of. I was actually 'anti dog.' If you brought your dog to our house it had to stay outside. I didn't know the names of my friends dogs. Dogs simply didn't matter at all to me. So when I had my 'dog awakening' it was a pretty huge life change.<br>
It all began with Ike, the German Shepherd - Rottweiler my musician daughter Sonya 'dog shared' in Brooklyn. Ike was her neighbor's dog. Sonya began jogging and dog sitting Ike and after the neighbor had a baby and moved across town, Ike began to live with Sonya part time. The first time Sonya brought Ike home it was love at first sight. And I had no allergic reaction. So began my new life as a dog person, and the 8 month hunt for OUR dog.<br>
 I really wanted a German Shepherd. Actually I really just wanted another Ike! We came close with a one year old GSD that we went to meet at an apartment in Springfield, MA.  He was kept in a bedroom where the whole wooden door was destroyed from him scratching at it. The owners had to find a new home for him because he barked all day while they were gone. It was tragic all the way around. For the owners who loved him, and for the dog who should not have been cooped up all day. I thought our 50 acres in the country would be perfect! They brought him for a visit and I saw that my husband Peter and son Max really liked this wild teenager of a dog - but he made me really nervous. The owners left and never called us back. I was relieved. I knew he was too much dog for me. <br>
In the meantime, I was getting to know my friends dogs and learn their names. I started dog sitting our neighbors dog Lexi. I like to call Lexi my 'starter dog'. I used to jog by their house and stop to pet Lexi if she was outside. I loved how she became so excited to see me! When I realized they were moving in a few months to be closer to work so they'd not have to leave her for 8 hrs at a time, I offered to pick her up on my morning jog and keep her until they came home. For free! This was great for all of us!  I loved jogging with her and having her in my studio at my feet.  I was sad on the weekends when I didn't have her. <br>Life as a 'dog person' was a whole new way of being in the world. I stopped to pet dogs and talk with the owners. I also spent a lot of time on Petfinder and making visits to shelters looking for 'our' dog. <br>
In November of 2012, Ike suddenly died. It was such a traumatic experience for Sonya. Getting someone to help her carry this over 100 lb dog into a cab, having to put him down, bringing him home and keeping him on ice in her bathtub for a day until the owner flew back from a trip. They drove Ike upstate to have a ceremony and burial for this magnificent beast who was beloved by so many people. I get teary just writing these words! I was blindsided and very surprised by the grief I felt at Ike's death. I've lost both parents to cancer, and many friends to Aids. I was shocked that this grief felt similar to the human grief I knew too well. And Ike wasn't even my dog! Part of it was feeling Sonya's grief, and part of it was my own, as I had formed a bond with Ike. I once drove two hours EACH way to pick Ike up while Sonya was on tour so I could have him to myself for 3 days. Sonya walked the streets of NYC with Ike off leash and took him everywhere. Ike was her protector.  <br>
